* Access to the chrome extension `Selenium IDE`. If Selenium IDE is not already installed on your browser, you can download it [**here**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd)

## Lab 1

In this lab, we'll create an integration that is triggered using a Scheduler and test it

* Login into Amplify Integration

  ![login screen](images/login-screen.png)

* Open this ([file](<Lab 1 automated.side>)) in Selenium IDE

* Click on the Run current test button
  ![Test running](<images/Test Running (Lab1) (2).png>)

* A green check should appear next to your test's name, indicating that your test was successful
  ![Test completed](<images/Lab1 automated test completed.png>)

Your final integration should look like this:

![Final](images/lab1-final-a.png)

## Lab 2

In this lab, we'll add an HTTP/S Client component (and associated connection) to our integration and test it.

* Continue from Lab 1 and copy the URL of your integration
 ![Link Copy](<images/Copy the link(lab1).png>)

* Open this [file](<Lab 2 automated.side>) in Selenium IDE

* Paste the Url in the Open command Target and in the Playback base URL field
 ![URL pasted](<images/paste the link.png>)

* Paste url for webhook site (WITHOUT THE `https://` PROTOCOL ) in the Value field of the 27th command
 ![Webhook url](<images/webhook url Lab2 helloworld.png>)

* Click on the Run current test button
 ![Running Lab 2](<images/Running Lab 2.png>)

* A green check should appear next to your test's name, indicating that your test was successful
 ![Lab 2 completed](<images/lab 2 completed.png>)

* See results in webhook site, the following Json text should appear:
 ```json
  {
    "text": "Hello world"
  â€Œ}
  ```
  ![Webhook results](<../amplify integration labs test/images/Webhook results.png>)

Your final integration should look like this:

![Final](images/lab2-final-a.png)

## Lab 3

In this lab, we'll replace the Scheduler component event trigger with an HTTP/S Server component (and associated connection) and test it.

* Continue from Lab 2 and copy the URL of your integration
  ![Link copy](</images/Copy Link Lab 3.png>)

* Paste the Url in the Open command Target and in the Playback base URL field
  ![Url pasted](<images/Changement URL lab 3.png>)

* Click on the Run current test button
  ![Running lab 3](<images/Running lab3.png>)

* A green check should appear next to your test's name, indicating that your test was successful
  ![Lab3 completed](<images/Lab3 completed.png>)

* Back to the integration copy the endpoint URL on the data plane  
  ![Enable Toggle](images/lab3-enable-c.png)

* In a separate browser tab paste the URL and enter a value for value (e.g. 10)

* See results in webhook site and see that the body is equal to the value you provided
  ![Results](<images/lab3 webhook results.png>)

Your final integration should look like this:

![Final](images/lab3-final-a.png)

## Lab 4

In this lab, we'll add some flow control logic and variables to our integration and test it.

* Continue from Lab 3 and copy the URL of your integration
  ![alt text](<Copy link Lab4.png>)

* Paste the Url in the Open command Target and in the Playback base URL field
  ![Url pasted](<images/Url pasted lab 4.png>)

* Click on the Run current test button
  ![Running lab 3](<images/Running lab3.png>)

* A green check should appear next to your test's name, indicating that your test was successful
  ![Lab4 completed](<images/Lab4 completed.png>)

* Activate your integration and trigger it with values greater than and less than 10 to see that only those greater than 10 are sent to webhook site. Verify by inspecting the transaction in the Monitor

Your final integration should look like this:
